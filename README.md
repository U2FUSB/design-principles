# Abstract Factory

## How to use it

Call a factory (for example userCreator).
As its argument, call another factory (for example proSubscriptionUserCreator)

## When to use

-   Similar kinds of objects need to be created dynamically (=usecase factory)
-   Even though they are of the same kind, they can be categorised into groups which need to be implemented differently
